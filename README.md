# TechConnect

## Introduction
This is a python library written to help control instruments over VISA/GPIB. Below you will find Installation instructions. Please keep in mind that this package is still in heavy development and there may be large refactoring/changes that could break code. I will try to maintain up-to-date documentation for reference at
https://techconnect.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
However, if you see a bug, or any missed/out-of-date documentation please feel free to contact me at

## Installation 
Due to the dev state of this package, currently the preferred method of installation is github cloning, and installation through pip. To do this first clone the github repo by:
```
git clone https://github.com/hockijo/TechConnect

Then navigate to the cloned directory in your preferred prompt for installing python packages(should be called TechConnect) and run the following:
```
pip install .
